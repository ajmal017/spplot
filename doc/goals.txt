What to do here:

- use ypython to get stock data
- use numpy or some combination of such libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas, etc) to organize/plot the data - financial guys like pandas
- find a graphics library to present the data


several modules? just one?
probably just one, but will need a user interface
- probs gtk or just tk which comes with python
- let's start with Tkinter then pyQT if that's not adequate

start with little experiments just trying to use the libraries:
- can I get a stock back from IBM
- don't worry about writing a program
- just see if you can make the libraries work for you
